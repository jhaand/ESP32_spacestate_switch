This project documents how to make a spacestate switch, connect it to the internet and make sure that the whole of hackerdom can see it. 

# Introduction

Most Hackerspaces andmakerspaces want the rest of the world to know that people are there. This is done via the Spacestate switch near the entrance of the door. 
When someone comes in, they flip the switch and a website like https://mapall.space can show that the space is open. When the last person leaves, flip the switch off and the rest of the world can see that nobody's home.
